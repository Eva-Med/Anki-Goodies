Creating Anki Flashcards in a Text File
==

For me, text files are the only way to create Anki notes. To create notes, I never use the GUI or Ankidroid. 

Some of the benefits of using text files:

1. Extremely fast to create. Just separate fields with a semi-colon.

2. Easy to edit (Ctrl + F).  

3. Easy to get a bird's eye view.

That being said, when you modify the front card of an existing note, some coordination using  the card browser is required. Some day I may explain the workflow.

In the meantime, I wanted to share a [syntax-coloring scheme for the text editor EditPad Pro](https://github.com/boolbag/Anki-Goodies/tree/master/Creating%20Notes%20in%20Text%20Editor/Syntax%20Coloring%20Scheme%20for%20EditPad%20Pro), a scheme I created to make it easier to create three-field Anki notes.
