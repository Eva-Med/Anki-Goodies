## First, a Screenshot

## A Few Words About the Scheme

* This is a scheme specifically for notes with **three fields**: front, back and tags
* Within fields, html syntax pops out
* Comments starting with a # are also colored
* Within comments, urls — such as http://www.github.com — are underlined and clickable
* The beginning and end of each field is understood by EditPad as a "Bracket marker", which means you can quickly select an entire field, or navigate to each end of a field 
* There is a fair amount of syntax-checking to check that cards are well-formed
* The following screenshots should give you a good idea of what is going on

## How to Install?

1. Don't have EditPad Pro? Get the **[click here for a free trial](http://yu8.us/eppdemo)**

2. Installing the actual syntax-coloring scheme
 
   * Semi-Automatic Method. Like for all other syntax-coloring schemes, within EditPad, go to _Options / Configure File Types / Colors and Syntax Tab / Syntax Coloring Scheme pull-down menu_ and hit _Download_.

   * Manual Method: drop the `.jgcscs` file at the top of this page into the `%APPDATA%\JGsoft\EditPad Pro 7` folder (to navigate to that folder, copy that path and paste it in the address bar of your file manager, e.g. Windows Explorer)

3. If you want to be able to select the entire Front or Back of a card with one shortcut, download _Select Between Brackets (EPP Macro).ini_, then in EPP go to _Macros / Organize macros / Import_ [Due to the nature of the "virtual brackets" defined in the scheme, the _Block / Between Matching Brackets_ command misses one character.]
